      Jean-Michel Basquiat (December 22, 1960 – August 12, 1988) was an American
      artist who rose to success during the 1980s as part of the
      Neo-expressionism movement. Basquiat first achieved fame as part of the
      graffiti duo SAMO, alongside Al Diaz, writing enigmatic epigrams in the
      cultural hotbed of Manhattan's Lower East Side during the late 1970s,
      where rap, punk, and street art coalesced into early hip-hop music
      culture.

      By the early 1980s, his paintings were being exhibited in galleries and
      museums internationally. At 21, Basquiat became the youngest artist to
      ever take part in documenta in Kassel. At 22, he was one of the youngest
      to exhibit at the Whitney Biennial in New York. The Whitney Museum of
      American Art held a retrospective of his artwork in 1992. Basquiat's art
      focused on dichotomies such as wealth versus poverty, integration versus
      segregation, and inner versus outer experience.

      He appropriated poetry, drawing, and painting, and married text and image,
      abstraction, figuration, and historical information mixed with
      contemporary critique. He used social commentary in his paintings as a
      tool for introspection and for identifying with his experiences in the
      Black community, as well as attacks on power structures and systems of
      racism. His visual poetics were acutely political and direct in their
      criticism of colonialism and support for class struggle.

      Since Basquiat's death at the age of 27 from a heroin overdose in 1988,
      his work has steadily increased in value. In 2017, Untitled, a 1982
      painting depicting a black skull with red and yellow rivulets, sold for a
      record-breaking $110.5 million, becoming one of the most expensive
      paintings ever purchased. Basquiat was born on December 22, 1960, in Park
      Slope, Brooklyn, New York City, the second of four children to Matilde
      Basquiat (1934-2008) and Gérard Basquiat (1930-2013). He had an older
      brother, Max, who died shortly before his birth, and two younger sisters,
      Lisane (b. 1964) and Jeanine (b. 1967). His father was born in
      Port-au-Prince, Haiti and his mother was born in Brooklyn to Puerto Rican
      parents. He was raised Catholic.

      Matilde instilled a love for art in her young son by taking him to local
      art museums and enrolling him as a junior member of the Brooklyn Museum of
      Art. Basquiat was a precocious child who learned to read and write by the
      age of four. His mother encouraged her son's artistic talent and he often
      tried to draw his favorite cartoons. In 1967, he started attending Saint
      Ann's School, an arts-oriented private school. There he met his friend
      Marc Prozzo and together they created a children's book, written by
      Basquiat at the age of seven and illustrated by Prozzo.
