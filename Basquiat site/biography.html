        Jean-Michel Basquiat was a Neo-Expressionist painter in the 1980s. He is
        best known for his primitive style and his collaboration with pop artist
        Andy Warhol.

      <p>
        Basquiat first attracted attention for his graffiti under the name
        "SAMO" in New York City. He sold sweatshirts and postcards featuring his
        artwork on the streets before his painting career took off. He
        collaborated with Andy Warhol in the mid-1980s, which resulted in a show
        of their work. Basquiat died on August 12, 1988, in New York City.

      <p class="line">
        Basquiat was born in Brooklyn, New York, on December 22, 1960. With a
        Haitian-American father and a Puerto Rican mother, Basquiat's diverse
        cultural heritage was one of his many sources of inspiration. A
        self-taught artist, Basquiat began drawing at an early age on sheets of
        paper his father, an accountant, brought home from the office. As he
        delved deeper into his creative side, his mother strongly encouraged him
        to pursue his artistic talents.

        Basquiat first attracted attention for his graffiti in New York City in
        the late 1970s, under the name "SAMO." Working with a close friend, he
        tagged subway trains and Manhattan buildings with cryptic aphorisms. In
        1977 Basquiat quit high school a year before he was slated to graduate.
        To make ends meet, he sold sweatshirts and postcards featuring his
        artwork on the streets of his native New York.

        In his earlier works, Basquiat was known for using a crown motif, which
        was his way of celebrating Black people as majestic royalty or deeming
        them as saints. Describing the crown itself in further detail, artist
        Francesco Clemente posited: "Jean-Michel’s crown has three peaks, for
        his three royal lineages: the poet, the musician, the great boxing
        champion. Jean measured his skill against all he deemed strong, without
        prejudice as to their taste or age."

        Three years of struggle gave way to fame in 1980 when Basquiat's work
        was featured in a group show. His work and style received critical
        acclaim for the fusion of words, symbols, stick figures, and animals.
        Soon, his paintings came to be adored by an art-loving public that had
        no problem paying as much as $50,000 for a Basquiat original. His rise
        coincided with the emergence of a new art movement, Neo-Expressionism,
        ushering in a wave of new, young and experimental artists that included
        Julian Schnabel and Susan Rothenberg. In 2017, a Japanese billionaire
        broke a record when he bought Basquiat's “Untitled,” a 1982 painting of
        a skull, for $110.5 million at a Sotheby’s auction.

        As his popularity soared, so did Basquiat's personal problems. By the
        mid-1980s, friends became increasingly concerned by his excessive drug
        use. He became paranoid and isolated himself from the world around him
        for long stretches. Desperate to kick a heroin addiction, he left New
        York for Hawaii in 1988, returning a few months later and claiming to be
        sober. Sadly, he wasn't. Basquiat died of a drug overdose on August 12,
        1988, in New York City. He was 27 years old. Although his art career was
        brief, Basquiat has been credited with bringing the African American and
        Latino experience into the elite art world. After his death, the artist
        was back in the spotlight in May 2017 when a Japanese billionaire bought
        “Untitled,” a 1982 painting of a skull, for $110.5 million at a
        Sotheby’s auction. The sale set a record for the highest price for a
        work by an American artist and for an artwork created after 1980. It was
        also the highest price for a painting by Basquiat and by a Black artist.
