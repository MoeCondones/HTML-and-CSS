          >Riddle Me This Batman was created in 1987, just one year before
          Basquiat died in 1988, aged just 28. This art work was made using
          acrylic crayon on paper, a medium that Basquiat used in several other
          of his works. This drawing is, as its title suggests, clearly a
          reference to the popular Batman comic and movie franchise. In the
          drawing, we can see Batman, Robin and the Joker. However, these easily
          recognisable cultural symbols are problematised, and somewhat
          subverted.</span

          >The self-portrait painting is one of many painting that Jean-Michel
          Basquiat did to depict certain issues in the society through painting.
          Jean-Michel Basquiat used bright and cool colors in the painting which
          makes to show the true artistic work in the painting.</span

          >Basquiat created this piece, now known as Fallen Angel, in 1981. It
          was one of his early works, as he made the crossover from street art
          to painting on canvas. Still filled with his raw energy and emotion,
          Basquiat used acrylics, oilstick and spray paint to create this image.
          The colours used by Basquiat have been described as "the colours of
          the street" by writer, Prat, an apt description of the bright star who
          developed his skills as part of the graffiti duo SAMO.</span

          >The piece was sold at auction in France as recently as 2017 for the
          highest price yet achieved by any Basquiat paintings within this
          country. Most of his privately owned pieces remain dotted around his
          native US, including a large proportion of his output from the 1980s.
          He was highly prolific though, so there was plenty else to also
          feature within some notable public art galleries and museums. This
          particular piece measures over two metres in width and height, with
          the artist hoping to combine his bold content with large canvases to
          create an overwhelming experience for viewers of his work. He is known
          to have used acrylic and grease pencil on wood for this artwork and a
          considerable amount of research was completed on it in the lead up to
          its private sale back in 2017.</span
