          <p>Riddle Me This Batman</p>

            >Riddle Me This Batman was created in 1987, just one year before
            Basquiat died in 1988, aged just 28. This art work was made using
            acrylic crayon on paper, a medium that Basquiat used in several
            other of his works. This drawing is, as its title suggests, clearly
            a reference to the popular Batman comic and movie franchise. In the
            drawing, we can see Batman, Robin and the Joker. However, these
            easily recognisable cultural symbols are problematised, and somewhat
            subverted.</span

          <span>
            The self-portrait painting is one of many painting that Jean-Michel
            Basquiat did to depict certain issues in the society through
            painting. Jean-Michel Basquiat used bright and cool colors in the
            painting which makes to show the true artistic work in the painting.

          <span
            >Basquiat created this piece, now known as Fallen Angel, in 1981. It
            was one of his early works, as he made the crossover from street art
            to painting on canvas. Still filled with his raw energy and emotion,
            Basquiat used acrylics, oilstick and spray paint to create this
            image. The colours used by Basquiat have been described as "the
            colours of the street" by writer, Prat, an apt description of the
            bright star who developed his skills as part of the graffiti duo
            SAMO.</span

          <span
            >The piece was sold at auction in France as recently as 2017 for the
            highest price yet achieved by any Basquiat paintings within this
            country. Most of his privately owned pieces remain dotted around his
            native US, including a large proportion of his output from the
            1980s. He was highly prolific though, so there was plenty else to
            also feature within some notable public art galleries and museums.
            This particular piece measures over two metres in width and height,
            with the artist hoping to combine his bold content with large
            canvases to create an overwhelming experience for viewers of his
            work. He is known to have used acrylic and grease pencil on wood for
            this artwork and a considerable amount of research was completed on
            it in the lead up to its private sale back in 2017.</span

            >Untitled II 1982 is an acrylic painting on canvas painting that
            Jean-Michel Basquiat did in 1982. The American painter later sold
            the artwork to a Japanese billionaire called YusakuMaezawa at a
            whopping $110.5 million. Today, the painting is held on loan at the
            Brooklyn Museum and displayed at the Seattle Museum.</span
